# Tortle

Like `turtle`, but not. An experimental work in progress for getting a version
of Python's `turtle` module to work in the browser. This work started from the
[code created for the Basthon project](https://framagit.org/basthon/basthon-kernel/-/tree/master/packages/kernel-python3/src/modules/turtle)
which was, itself, based upon work from [the Brython project](https://brython.info/).
Since this is derived code, the license is GPL3.

```
make turtle
make serve
```

Then point to: https://localhost:8000/

More soon...
